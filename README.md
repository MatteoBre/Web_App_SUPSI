# Web_App_SUPSI
Project done in the sixth semester of my Bachelor's

It is a Web Application with a back-end in SPRING, the front-end is done HTML, CSS (with the help of bootstrap).

I used a template Engine to let front-end and back-end interact.

There is also a small part done in JavaScript that uses AJAX calls.
